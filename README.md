# Build a Custom Model to Detect Anomolies on a Production Floor

## Overview

In this guide, you will learn to simulate production data, analyze it, and detect anomalies using Snowflake and machine learning.  
By the end, you will have a registered anomaly detection model in Snowflake's Model Registry.
